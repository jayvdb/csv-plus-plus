# Introduction

csv++ is a superset of CSV which aims to make spreadsheet authoring more akin to traditional
software development with a compiler that can output to Excel, Google Sheets or CSV.  That 
means you can edit your spreadsheet in plain text, share functions between various spreadsheets
and commit your code to version control.
